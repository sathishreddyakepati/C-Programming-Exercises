## C Programming Practice Sets – Code With Harry

### Timeline & Progress
I am documenting my journey learning C programming with Code With Harry’s course. Up to now, I’ve completed practice sets for Chapters 1–8.

**Learning Timeline:**
- Chapter 1: Basics of C
- Chapter 2: Data Types
- Chapter 3: Operators & Expressions
- Chapter 4: Control Flow
- Chapter 5: Functions
- Chapter 6: Arrays
- Chapter 7: Strings
- Chapter 8: Practice Set

**Notes on the Code:**
- Most problems are straightforward, so I haven’t added extensive comments.
- Some solutions are my own approaches beyond the standard practice sets.
- Each chapter’s practice set is included as a separate file/folder.

**Why I Did This:**
- Strengthen programming basics
- Practice problem-solving in C
- Build my coding portfolio and track progress

**Next Steps:**
- Continue with upcoming chapters
- Add projects and more practice sets
- Explore real-world C programming tasks
